Welcome to the GenAI-related code challenge for a full-stack developer. It's involves creating a simple web application that integrates an AI model to provide a sentimental analyses. 

## Objective
Develop a web application that allows users to input text and receive a sentiment analysis score (positive, negative, neutral) using a pre-trained AI model.

## Frontend
Create a user interface with a **text input box** and a **submit button**.
Display the sentiment score and a **textual** sentiment (e.g., "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral") upon submission

### Technical Specifications
Use the `app` solution folder to include the source code with any modern JavaScript framework (React, Angular, Ionic).
Ensure the UI uses a style component tool and user-friendly.

### Deployment
Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku)

## Data Flow:
The frontend should send the user's text input to the backend via a **POST** request.
The backend should process this input using the sentiment analysis model and **return the results** to the frontend.

## Definition of Done
1. Micro frontend with UI requirements implemented
2. Frontend deployed and acessible via public URL.
3. Communication to a backend that will receive text for sentimental analyses.
